# wes-anderson-vs-code-themes
A repository housing themes for VS Code inspired by Wes Anderson films

## The Life Aquatic
Starting with _The Life Aquatic_ as it is one of my favourites. I have started the dark theme, it still needs some work, though. Eventually would like a light theme, and maybe even some Steve Zissou "personal" themes.

Feel free to improve upon any present themes or start new ones. Please add to this readme as appropriate when you do.
